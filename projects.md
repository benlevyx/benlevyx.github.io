* [#democracy](https://benlevyx.github.io/twitter-polling/): trying to predict public opinion polls in the 2020 Democratic primaries using Twitter, NLP, and Bayesian modelling. Tools used: AWS, TWINT (Python package), Keras.
* [Using topic-controlled document vectors to measure the ideological slant of news media](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1I46GxfbZ4VWRstxKtTDZBnNnoBIFhC4F): A summer research project at the University of Toronto where I built a machine learning model to detect the ideological slant of news articles. Tools used: crowdsourcing, word vectors, neural nets. Libraries: spaCy, Keras. 

### Statistics

### Data Visualization

* [Normalizing flows](https://benlevyx.github.io/vi-normflows/app/): A visualization of normalizing flows, a technique for transforming simple distributions into more complex ones for use in variational inference. From [Rezende & Mohamed, 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05770). Made with D3.js
* [Marvel Cinematic Universe](https://patsukhum.github.io/Marvel/): Exploring the success and dominance of the Marvel Cinematic Universe film franchise. Made with D3.js
