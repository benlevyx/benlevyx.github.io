message: "This is great! I've been reading Daniel Kahneman's \"Thinking Fast and Slow\" recently and it has had me thinking on just how inaccurate our quickly judged conclusions are, and how it can be mitigated by using a calculated approach. It is fascinating to see such a relevant example. It has also given me a new appreciation for how useful (and interesting) a tool statistics can be for calculating predictions on anything that peaks my curiosity. So thanks for the post and I look forward to reading part 2, it's also motivates me to start on my essay about the Bayesian Mind.\r\n\r\nStay safe and take care!"
