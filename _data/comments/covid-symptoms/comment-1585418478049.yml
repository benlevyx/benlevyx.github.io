message: "Enjoyed your article and I agree with what you write but I would make a couple of additions. First, is there \"evidence\" that one has covid-19 based on the probabilities you quote? I would say absolutely yes simply because the posterior probability is bigger than the prior probability. Evidence is measured by change in belief while probability measures belief (not evidence). Given that there is evidence of having the virus, one wonders at the strength of that evidence, is it strong, moderate, weak, etc.? That is a more complicated issue in general but in this context a natural way to measure the strength is the posterior probability and I would say it is at the very least moderately strong based on the numbers you quote. That raises the question of what one does about this evidence, irrespective of how strong it is, and that requires bringing consequences into the picture. Typically consequences have nothing to do with statistics although they might be able to be expressed numerically via a so-called loss function. In this case I don't think a loss function is required when one considers the consequences of being a spreader of the disease and so, based on the evidence, I would self-isolate.  Of course, this is the right conclusion irrespective of the evidence for a bunch of reasons but I do think the statistical evidence does support that conclusion in this case. I have a particular beef about how evidence is treated in statistics which is why I've posted this. Good luck with your studies.\r\n \r\nAll the best, Mike\r\n \r\nP.S. It is unfortunate that the field has decided to call p(D) the \"evidence\" because it isn't. The data does contain the evidence concerning the problem of interest but the question is how to express that evidence."
